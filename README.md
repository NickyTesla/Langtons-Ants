## Ants in the Ointment


A little experiment that uses a variation on the Langton's Ants Algorithm to create emergent patterns on a pixelated image.  

Cells are assigned states and dictate whether an "ant" that moves into will turn 90 degrees to the left or right at that cell.  Meanwhile "ants" are swapping pixels in front and behind them to diffuse the original image.

Hopefully a pleasant watching experience
